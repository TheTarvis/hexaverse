## 🧪 Mechanics

### Fog of War / Scan Radius
- Players only see a limited number of tiles around their closest unit or base (e.g. radius 4).
- Exploration is required to discover resources, hazards, or other players.

### Spawn with Padding, But Not Isolation
- Players are spawned at least `minDistance` apart (e.g. 8–10 tiles).
- But also within `maxDistance` of another colony (e.g. 20–25 tiles).
- This ensures each player has space to grow, but always someone nearby to discover and engage with.

### Procedural Galactic Terrain

Use simplex or perlin noise to generate a rich, organic structure to the galaxy. Each tile’s noise value determines its underlying environment, creating strategic diversity across space:

- **Star-Rich Sectors**: High-density stellar regions teeming with valuable systems, ancient ruins, and prime colony sites. These become hotspots for competition and conflict.
- **Dead Zones**: Vast stretches of interstellar void, low-resource and sparsely populated. Often used as natural buffers between factions or hiding spots for fringe colonies.
- **Galactic Barriers**: Features like dark nebulae, unstable asteroid fields, ion storms, or gravitic distortions. These form soft borders that impact movement, scanning, and expansion routes.

> This system ensures the galaxy feels alive — with clustered opportunity, dangerous wilds, and strategically significant terrain shaping every decision.


### Movement Limits / Travel Costs
- Add movement limitations or designate "space lanes" to control player expansion rate.
- Enables the creation of **choke points** and strategic zones.

## 📘 Dictionary

- **Unit**: The base object type from which all other player entities (e.g. ships, bases, structures) are derived.
- **Colony**: A collection of units controlled by a player; defines their first foothold and grows into a territory.
- **Territory**: A system-defined collection of tiles considered under a player's influence. Used for expansion, leaderboard scoring, and conflict boundaries.

---

## 🚀 Unit Types *(name pending — “Assets”? “Entities”?)*

- **Ship**
  - Mobile unit capable of exploration, transport, or combat.

- **Base**
  - Stationary unit that establishes player presence and extends territorial influence.
  - Influence radius increases with base strength or upgrades.

- **Site**
  - Specialized unit type focused on economy or science.
  - Subtypes:
    - **Mining Site**: Extracts nearby resources.
    - **Research Site**: Generates research points or tech bonuses.

- **[Other Ideas]**
  - **Probe / Drone**: Lightweight exploratory unit.
  - **Relay**: Extends visibility or communications range.
  - **Outpost**: Minimal infrastructure for early presence or quick expansion.

## 🌍 Territory Logic

A tile is considered to be under a player's **influence** (i.e. control) when it meets any of the following:

### Presence Rule
- The tile contains at least one of the player’s units *and* no units from other players.
- Encourages active control and risk-taking.

### Base Influence Rule
- The tile lies within a set range of a **Base**.
- Influence radius is determined by base strength or level.
  - Example: Tier 1 base = radius 3; Tier 2 = radius 5.

### Path Rule *(optional, future concept)*
- Influence may only spread through contiguous paths of friendly-controlled tiles or structures.
- Prevents isolated "reach" across space and encourages cohesion.

> These rules define the **Territory Score** for leaderboards and strategic metrics.

## 🎮 Colony Creation

When a player starts a new colony:
- They are assigned a **starting territory** using spawn logic (noise, spacing, etc.).
- They receive a **default unit package**, e.g.:
  - 1× Base (Tier 1)
  - 2× Ships
  - 1× Mining Site (unplaced)

- The surrounding tiles are fogged and must be explored.
- The initial territory is seeded based on the base’s influence range.

## 🛰️ Tile Adjacency + Travel Rules

### Tile Scale
- Each tile represents **1 light-year of space**.
- Galaxy is modeled as a **hex grid** using axial coordinates.
- Galaxy radius = ~50 tiles → ~7,651 tiles total (full map).
- Most tiles are empty; only ~10–20% contain stars, systems, or anomalies.

---

### Movement Types

#### 🚧 Sublight Travel (Default)
- Ships can move **1 tile per turn** (or per X real-time minutes/hours).
- Base movement available to all units.
- Affected by tile traits (e.g. nebula = slow, void = blocked).

#### ⚡ FTL Travel (Upgrades Required)
- Tiered unlocks allow faster or longer-distance jumps:
  - Tier 1: Jump in straight line up to 2 tiles.
  - Tier 2: Jump radius of 2 tiles in any direction.
  - Tier 3: Teleport within local sector.

- FTL movement consumes energy or incurs cooldowns.

#### 🌐 Relay Chains
- Player-built infrastructure that allows near-instant travel between **connected relay stations**.
- Enables fast travel across controlled space or faction networks.

#### 🌀 Wormholes
- Natural or constructed portals that enable **intergalactic or cross-galaxy travel**.
- May be one-way, unstable, or require high-tier tech to use or activate.

---

### Scan & Visibility

#### 👁️ Scan Radius
- Units and structures provide vision in a radius (e.g. 2–4 tiles).
- Visibility can be enhanced by relays or tech.
- Certain tile traits (e.g. nebulas) reduce or block scans.

#### 🛡️ Influence Radius
- Bases project a control radius (e.g. 3–5 tiles) that defines owned territory.
- Influence may only expand through **connected, occupied tiles**.

### Tile Traits (Optional Layer)

| Trait     | Effect                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Nebula**| Slows movement, reduces scan range          |
| **Void**  | May prevent FTL or block movement entirely  |
| **Gravity Well** | Blocks jump-in from FTL; slingshot out allowed |
| **Anomaly** | May grant bonuses or trigger special events |

---

### Advanced Concepts

- **Directional movement costs** (space currents, seasonal distortions).
- **Persistent drift**: units with no engine slowly move through space over real time.
- **Deep-space beaconing**: players can call for help, reinforcements, or send messages across long distances.
