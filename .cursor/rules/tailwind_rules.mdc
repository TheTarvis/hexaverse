# Tailwind CSS Configuration Rules

## Version Requirements
- DO NOT change the Tailwind CSS version from ^4.1.3
- DO NOT change the @tailwindcss/postcss version from ^4.1.3
- These specific versions are required for proper component styling and CSS variable support

## CSS Variables
- All components depend on CSS variables defined in the tailwind.config.mjs file
- The `--color`, `--spacing`, and `--radius-lg` variables are essential for component styling
- Never remove or modify these variable definitions

## PostCSS Configuration
- Always use @tailwindcss/postcss plugin in postcss.config.mjs
- DO NOT replace with standard tailwindcss plugin - it lacks required features
- Keep autoprefixer enabled

## CSS Import Syntax
- Use `@import 'tailwindcss'` in src/styles/tailwind.css
- DO NOT replace with @tailwind directives as they're incompatible with v4 

## Component Styling
- Button and Dropdown components rely on specific CSS variable syntax
- CSS references like `bg-(--btn-border)` require the Tailwind v4 variable handling
- Never "simplify" these class names as they depend on v4's CSS variable resolution
