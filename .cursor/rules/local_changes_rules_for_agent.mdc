- After the agent has completed the request from the user it will offer to make a new commit. 
- This commit name should follow this pattern. "[v0.0.0] - Commit Message Desbribing Changes".
- For all local changes, just increment the minor value. For example, if the current version is v0.2.11, after the cahnges the version would be v.0.2.12. 
- Use the version from the package.json and should update that value before commiting.
- Add changes to the CHANGELOG.md
- Never change the major and minor versions, only patch versions. [vmajor.minor.patch]
