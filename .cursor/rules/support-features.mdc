# Support Features Guide

## Support Page Structure

The support system is built around [support/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/support/page.tsx) and follows these principles:

1. User submissions are categorized as:
   - Feature Ideas
   - Problem Reports
   - Other Inquiries

2. Each submission requires:
   - Category selection
   - Title
   - Detailed description

## Form State Management

Support forms should manage these states:
```tsx
const [category, setCategory] = useState<SupportCategory>('idea');
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
const [submitSuccess, setSubmitSuccess] = useState(false);
```

## Success Feedback

Show success messages using this structure:
```tsx
{submitSuccess && (
  <div className="bg-green-100 border border-green-400 text-green-700 px-4 py-3 rounded mb-6">
    Thank you for your submission! We'll review it and get back to you soon.
  </div>
)}
```

## Form Reset

After successful submission:
1. Clear all form fields
2. Reset category to default
3. Show success message
4. Re-enable submit button
